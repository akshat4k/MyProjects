RAKSHA is an innovative application that merges various computational techniques to address resource allocation and optimization challenges. This project integrates:

User Management System: A secure and robust user registration and login system.
Knapsack Problem Solver: Implements dynamic programming to optimize resource allocation via airways, railways, and roadways, ensuring maximum value under given constraints.
Shortest Path Finder: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the most efficient routes between cities, optimizing travel paths.
Network Flow Optimization: Applies the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow in a network, supporting complex decision-making processes.
With a focus on user interaction, RAKSHA is designed to be both intuitive and educational, providing clear outputs and saving results for further analysis. Whether you're managing logistics or simply exploring algorithmic solutions, RAKSHA offers a versatile and powerful toolset.
